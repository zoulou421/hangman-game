#  This is a hangman game in python

This game allows you to manipulate files in python

The first point of the mission is to create a hangman game. Project description: the computer chooses a
random word in a list, a word of eight letters maximum. The player tries to find the letters making up the word. Every
Suddenly, he grabbed a letter. If the letter appears in the word, the computer displays the word with the letters already found. Those who do not
are not yet are replaced by stars (*). The player has 8 chances. Beyond that, he loses.
We are going to complicate the rules a little by asking the player to give their name at the start of the game. This will allow the
program to record your score.

#The technical side of the problem: 

I remind you that the player must not
only give one letter at a time and the program must check that this is the case before continuing. We will
split our program into three files:
The data.py file which will contain the variables necessary for our application (the list of words, the number of
authorized chancesâ€¦).
The functions.py file which will contain the functions useful to our application. There, I am not giving you any clear list,
I advise you to think about it carefully, with a sheet of paper and a pen if that helps you (What are the actions of my
program ? What can I put in functions?).
Finally, our hangman.py file which will contain our hangman game.

#Manage scores:

we will save to a file
data, which we will call scores (without any extension) the scores of the game. These scores will be in the form of a
dictionary: in keys, we will have the names of the players and in values â€‹â€‹the scores, in the form of integers.
The following cases must be managed:
The file does not exist. There, we create an empty dictionary, no score was found.
Player is not in the dictionary. In this case, we add it with a score of 0.
